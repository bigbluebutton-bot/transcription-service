# BBB transcription bot

![Project Logo](img/transcription-pipeline.png)

## Overview

This project aims to provide live transcription services for BigBlueButton (BBB) meetings, enabling real-time subtitles for participants. The transcription pipeline processes the audio stream from BBB meetings, converts speech to text using advanced speech recognition models, and delivers accurate subtitles to enhance accessibility and engagement. It uses the [stream_pipeline](https://github.com/JulianKropp/stream_pipeline)-framework to process the audio stream. This project is part of a larger project ([BBB Translation Bot repository](https://github.com/bigbluebutton-bot/bbb-translation-bot)).

## Features

- **Live Transcription:** Converts live speech in BBB to text using advanced speech recognition models.
- **Simulation Mode:** Allows testing the transcription pipeline with pre-recorded audio files.
- **Modular Architecture:** Each module handles a specific task within the pipeline, ensuring scalability and maintainability.

## Getting Started

Follow these simple steps to quickly set up the BBB-Translation-Bot.

### Hardware
This setup was testet with a Nvidia RTX 4090 GPU. The GPU is used for the transcription and translation of the audio stream.

### Install Nvidia drivers for Ubuntu:
Refer to the official [Nvidia documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/tesla/tesla-installation-notes/index.html#ubuntu-lts):
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install linux-headers-$(uname -r)
distribution=$(. /etc/os-release;echo $ID$VERSION_ID | sed -e 's/\.//g')
wget https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/$distribution/x86_64/cuda-keyring_1.0-1_all.deb
sudo dpkg -i cuda-keyring_1.0-1_all.deb
sudo apt update
sudo apt -y install cuda-drivers
sudo reboot now
```

### Docker with GPU support
Ensure Docker with GPU support is installed on your system:
Refer to the official [Nvidia documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html)

```bash
sudo apt update

curl -sSL https://get.docker.com | sh

curl -fsSL https://nvidia.github.io/libnvidia-container/gpgkey | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/nvidia-container-toolkit-keyring.gpg \
  && curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/libnvidia-container/stable/deb/nvidia-container-toolkit.list | \
    sed 's#deb https://#deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/nvidia-container-toolkit-keyring.gpg] https://#g' | \
    sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nvidia-container-toolkit.list \
  && \
    sudo apt-get update

sudo apt install nvidia-container-runtime

which nvidia-container-runtime-hook

sudo systemctl restart docker

docker run -it --rm --gpus all ubuntu nvidia-smi # Test GPU support
```

### Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JulianKropp/bbb-transcription-bot.git
   cd bbb-transcription-bot
   ```

2. **Configure Environment Variables:**
    If you only want to run the simulation, you can skip this step. And go to [Simulation](#simulation)

   - Duplicate the `.env_example` file and rename it to `.env`.

     ```bash
     cp .env_example .env
     ```

   - Open the `.env` file and configure the necessary environment variables as per your setup.

3. **Start the Application:**

   ```bash
   docker compose up
   ```

   This command will build and start all necessary services defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

## Usage

Once the application is running, it will crreate a meeting and process the audio stream from this BBB meeting and provide live subtitles. This version was only tested with BBB 2.5.

## Simulation

A simulation mode is available to test the transcription pipeline without needing a live BBB session.

### Steps to Use Simulation:

1. **Add an Audio File:**

   - Place your audio file (any format) into the `audio` folder of the project.

2. **Run the Simulation:**

   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker-compose-simulation.yml up
   ```

   This command will start a simulation that plays the audio file as if it were live. The simulation results will be stored in the `simulate_results` folder.

3. **Review Results:**

   - The `simulate_results` folder contains graphs and output files that display the Word Error Rate (WER) and latency metrics, indicating how long it takes for spoken words to be transcribed.

**Note:** Multiple simulations may run one after the other, which can extend the total processing time.

## Modules

The transcription pipeline is built using a modular architecture, where each module handles a specific task to efficiently process the audio stream from BBB and generate accurate live transcripts. This design ensures scalability, maintainability, and ease of testing.

### Key Modules

1. **Audio Buffer Module**
   
   - **Purpose:** Creates a n-second audio buffer from the live audio stream to ensure optimal performance with Whisper.
   - **Functionality:** Implements an OGG reader to parse audio data into manageable chunks, maintaining a continuous buffer without introducing significant delays. This module is stateful and operates in a non-parallel mode to preserve buffer integrity.

2. **Flow Limiter Module**
   
   - **Purpose:** Controls the rate at which audio data packets enter the pipeline to manage processing load.
   - **Functionality:** Limits the number of data packets processed per second, preventing overload and ensuring consistent subtitle delivery. Operates in a non-parallel mode to maintain controlled data flow.

3. **Convert Audio Module**
   
   - **Purpose:** Standardizes incoming audio data into a uniform format suitable for processing.
   - **Functionality:** Utilizes `ffmpeg` to convert various audio formats to 16-bit linear PCM (mono, 16 kHz), then transforms the binary data into normalized NumPy arrays. This stateless module supports parallel processing with controlled data sequencing.

4. **VAD (Voice Activity Detection) Module**
   
   - **Purpose:** Identifies and isolates segments of the audio stream that contain speech.
   - **Functionality:** Detects speech activity to filter out silent passages, forwarding only relevant audio segments to the transcription model. Uses the same VAD model as WhisperX for enhanced accuracy and operates in a stateless, parallel mode.

5. **Whisper Module**
   
   - **Purpose:** Transcribes the buffered audio into text.
   - **Functionality:** Employs Faster Whisper to convert audio data into text, leveraging batching and word-level timestamps for improved efficiency and accuracy. Processes the 30-second audio buffer and integrates seamlessly with the VAD module's timestamps. This stateless module is designed for single-worker operation to optimize GPU usage.

6. **Confirm Words Module**
   
   - **Purpose:** Ensures the stability and accuracy of transcribed words over time.
   - **Functionality:** Confirms words after they have been stable for a configurable period (e.g., 2 seconds), preventing further modifications and maintaining transcript integrity. Handles exceptions for low-probability words and overlapping timestamps, ensuring consistent and reliable transcription results. This stateful module operates in a non-parallel mode to manage confirmed word states effectively.

Each module plays a critical role in the live transcription process, working together to deliver real-time, accurate subtitles in BBB meetings. The modular approach allows for easy updates and maintenance, leveraging the strengths of each component to build a robust transcription pipeline.
